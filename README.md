This is a project to test my HTML, CSS and JQuery skills. 

The task is to create a simple Blackjack game, where you play the computer one vs one, without betting.

I need to handle the logic to create a deck of cards, shuffle it, and deal cards to the dealer and the player.

The player should always understand what is going on, and should be able to either hit or stick.

They should be able to win or lose, and should be able to restart the game.
